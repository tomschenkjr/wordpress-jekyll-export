Topics covered in this slide:
<ul>
	<li> Creating linebreaks.</li>
	<li> Creating paragraphs.</li>
	<li> Preventing or forcing indentation.</li>
	<li> Creating chapters, sections, and subsections.</li>
</ul>
Creating spaces, new lines, and paragraphs seem like a trivial matter. There are a couple of ways to do each. LaTeX also ignores when there are multiple spaces, instead, it will insert a single space. For linebreaks, a simple return usually works; however, sometimes it is necessary to force a linebreak with a command (it will become obvious later when this is needed). Since LaTeX ignores multiple spacing, we cannot tab to create an indentation for a paragraph. Instead, after creating two linebreaks, LaTeX will assume it's a new paragraph and insert it's own indentation. We are able to control when LaTeX indents and when it does not through commands.

Another important command in LaTeX is its <em>chapter</em> and <em>section</em> command. With this command we can break our document into named and numbered sections. These sections will be automatically formatted (slightly larger and bolder text) and included in a table of contents if we deceide to include one. Section commands are very helpful for large documents and for creating a table of contents.
This slide show should take 10 to 20 minutes.
