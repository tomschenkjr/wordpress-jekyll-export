Topics covered on this webpage (no slides):
<ul>
	<li> Installing MiKTex - the TeX implementation.</li>
	<li> Installing TeXnicCenter - an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</li>
</ul>
This page will link the reader to MiKTeX and TeXnicCenter. To "compile" a document, one must have a L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X implementation installer on her computer. MiKTeX is a popular implementation of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X for Windows. I recommend that the reader uses this program.

A L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X document can be edited with any ASCII text editor, which is any text editor such as Wordpad, Notepad, or Microsoft Word--although it is rather cumbersome. One can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to create a document. An IDE is a fancy way of describing a program that allows the user to type, compile, and have a GUI interface with the document. As the reader will see in Lecture 2.3, compiling a document usually requires two programs to be open: the editor and a DOS window. An IDE makes it convienant to compile a document with a single program.

It also allows the author to have icons to insert functions. While this may seem to be antithetical to the essence of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, it is rather convienant for those commands or mathematical operators we seldomly use. Furthermore, it is still quicker to simply learn the commands and type them instead of using the icons.

Below points the reader to the webpage to install MiKTeX and TeXnicCenter. The reader <span style="text-decoration:underline;">must</span> install a L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X implementation--such as MiKTeX--to continue with the tutorial. TeXnicCenter, or any IDE, is optional, but recommended. The reader may continue the tutorial using Notepad or Wordpad as their editor.

<span>MiKTeX</span>
MiKTeX is a popular implementation of the L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X program. It manages the multiple files that L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X uses to create a program. MiKTeX has several useful features, such as autoinstalling packages (covered in lecture 2.1.1).

To install MiKTeX, follow the instructions below:
<ul>
	<li> Go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070715020834/http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/win32/miktex/setup/install.html">CTAN's webpage</a> on MiKTeX installation.</li>
	<li> When installing, use the "small" package set.</li>
</ul>
<span>TeXnicCenter</span>
Whereas MiKTeX (or a similar program) is necessary, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070715020834/http://www.toolscenter.org/front_content.php?idcat=26">TeXnicCenter</a> is not required. A L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X document can be edited with any text editor (Notepad, Wordpad preferrably) with ending the file name with .tex. However, unlike a text editor, TeXnicCenter is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which allows you to edit a document and generate its output. It also has some visual buttons for when you cannot remember L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X commands. NOTE: MiKTeX should be installed prior to installing TeXnicCenter.

To install TeXnicCenter, follow the instructions below:
<ul>
	<li> Go to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070715020834/http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/texniccenter/TXCSetup_1Beta6_31.exe?download">download page</a> and select a server.</li>
	<li> Double-click on installation file.</li>
	<li> Use MiKTeX as your local repository.</li>
</ul>
