Well-written books like <em>Hollowing Out the Middle</em> and <em>Caught in the Middle</em> have noted the net outward migration of education populations to urban areas. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago <a href="http://midwest.chicagofedblogs.org/archives/2011/11/nonmetropolitan.html">shows</a> that real per capita income shows there is not as much disparity in real income per capita between the upper Midwest metro areas and non-metro areas as one might guess.

Iowa, where research in <em>Hollowing Out the Middle </em>was based, has transformed from agriculture as a final good to agriculture as an input into manufacturing. The greater value-added from manufacturing--such a Marxian concept, I know--has helped keep real income higher in the non-metro areas.

This data does not negate the other concerns raised by the authors of the aforementioned books, but non-metro areas can provide a base for manufacturing that may not be easily outsourced.
