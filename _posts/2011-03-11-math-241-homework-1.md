2. Show, using a PivotChart, the number of males and females in this data set. Display this in a seperate sheet, named "PivotChart".

3. Create a scatterplot between VIQ and PIQ, set VIQ to the horizontal axis and PIQ on the vertical axis. Put this scatterplot in a new sheet titled "Scatterplot"

4. Create a histogram of weights, the bins should range from 100 to 200 in increments of 10. Place this histogram in a new sheet called "histogram".

5. Calculate the mean, median, and mode brain size (MRI_Count). Calculate each using the built-in Excel functions. Perform these calculations in the "Data" sheet.

6. Calculate the standard deviation of brain size using the same method we learned in class. Assume this is data consists of the entire population. Perform this calculation in the "Data" sheet.

7. Copy and paste the data below into an Excel worksheet (same workbook as above) and title it "Age".

8. Create a histogram for each age between 14 and 75. (e.g., there should be a bar for showing the frequency of each age). Place this graph in a sheet titled "Age-hist"

9. Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of age. (This is a tricky question, especially for mean and standard deviation. Refer back to the equations to derive a method to calculate this). Perform these calculations in the "Age" worksheet.

10. Delete any sheets not used in this homework. Please place the worksheets in this order: "Data", "PivotChart", "Scatterplot", "histogram", "Age", "Age-hist".
