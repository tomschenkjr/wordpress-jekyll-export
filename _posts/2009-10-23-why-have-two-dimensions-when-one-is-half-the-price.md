Data visualization is great because it can merges statistics--a largely positive science--with explanation. Thus, unacquainted individuals fully into a conversation without relying on complex structures. However, I think many writers on data visualization underestimate how easy it is to forget the positive statements from statistics and turns into rhetorical statistics without a good theoretical basis.

David McCandless and Stefanie Posavec from<a href="http://70.32.102.55/2009/left-vs-right/"> Information Is Beautiful</a> created an infographic of the distinction between left versus right in the United States and the European Union. Aesthetically, it's a nice piece that tries to capture familial, economic, and social aspects of ideologies--all appropriate for analysis. However, David and Stefanie try to fit it into an antiquated one-dimension (left and right) paradigm. Some items have been debunked--for both sides--by other authors, such as <a href="http://www.redbluerichpoor.com/">Andrew Gelman's book</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/blog/">his blog</a>.

Left versus right isn't a sufficient paradigm. In particular, the right has been wedged as a small government, psuedo-libertarian, theist-based party. But that isn't capturing the internal structure within that dimension. It doesn't describe <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/opinion/08kristol.html">big-government conservatives</a>, <a href="http://www.cato.org/">staunch libertarians</a>.

The best model for political philosophies is a two-dimensional (instead of one-dimensional) system. The diagram below from <a href="www.politicalcompass.org">Political Compass</a> shows the stance of beliefs in the economic realm (horizontal axis) and the social realm (vertical axis) based on the 2008 elections.

<p style="text-align:left;">A similar pattern is available for the European Union. <a href="http://infobeautiful.s3.amazonaws.com/leftright_EU_1416.gif">David and Stefanie's take on EU political spectrum</a> is here while <a href="http://politicalcompass.org/images/eu2008.gif">Political Compass has their own take</a>. Ultimately, this is tricky ground for infographics. David and Stefanie's analysis looks great, but it's based on a flawed model that has been adapted by others.</p>
