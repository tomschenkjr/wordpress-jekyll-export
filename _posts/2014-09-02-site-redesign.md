Quick news...the site received a header-to-footer redesign over the weekend. The front page no longer reveals a blog, but instead, a landing page with various links to different online presences. The blog and other pages also received a redesign, using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/invisible-assassin">Invisible Assassin</a> theme.

The blog is now located at tomschenkjr.net/blog. All links should be redirected to the new locations, but if not, drop me a line at the <a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/contact/">contact form</a> or through a social media account. In the next few days, I'll write a short post on the steps you should take when you want to: (1) create a custom, non-Wordpress landing page; (2) move WordPress installation from one directory to another; (3) only point your blog to a new page, without moving other pages. Stay tuned.
