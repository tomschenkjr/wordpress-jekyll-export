I've actually shown this graph before at a State Board of Education meeting last year. I don't think it was received as well as I had hoped. Many people were worried about the "complexity" of the diagram and I did hear some murmuring when I flipped to the slide. Below is the image of the graph and a fuller explanation is below the fold:

<a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/cc-funding-scatter.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-474" title="Share of Funding for Iowa Community Colleges: 1967-2008" src="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/cc-funding-scatter.png" alt="" width="600" height="480" /></a><!--more-->

The lightest points represent the late 60s and 70s and progressively become darker until the 2000s (black) and eventually 2008 is shown in red. This chart is an <a href="http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/tufte-charts-in-excel/">implementation</a> of a Tufte scatter plot in Excel. The negative trend shows the share of community college funding is becoming more reliant on tuition and fees and away from state general aid--the remaining is federal, local, and other funding.

Next year there is going to be a large shift toward federal funding from the <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx">ARRA monies</a> that supported all of education in Iowa.
