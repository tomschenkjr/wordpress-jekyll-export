Politics can't be captured as a <a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/2009/10/23/why-have-two-dimensions-when-one-is-half-the-price/">one dimensional left-versus-right</a> framework. So when one notes that young people are Democrates and older folk tend to be Republicans, it doesn't capture the complete spectrum of political beliefs. Are 18 year-olds Democrats because they believe in individual liberty, such as abortion and drug possession, or because the favor restrictions on trade?

<a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2010/03/30/the-democrats-are-doomed-or-how-a-big-tent-can-be-too-big/">OKCupid</a> charts the progress of political beliefs from 18 to 60 year-olds on a  two dimensional plane. Their progress reveals that, indeed, young individuals start as Democrat-types and then progress toward Republican-types. But young individuals begin as socially and economically liberal, but take on more restrictive views in economics while maintaining their social liberalism. Meanwhile, they present the data in a pretty sharp graph:

A note on the methodology. It appears this is a cross-section survey of 172,853 people at a given time. Thus, the researchers can't decouple age from generations. That is, today's 18 year-old may be libertarian, but that could be a fact for millennials, not from age. The next generation may introduce a different age-politics profile.
