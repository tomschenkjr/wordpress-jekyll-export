<a href="http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/MLSOverviewPage?sid=qqH6pKXKpJXL">Here</a> are lecture notes on GDP, returns to scale, production, and growth theories.

NOTE: there is audio associated with these files. Click on the green text to jump to specific parts of the lecture. I missed the first 5 minutes of the lecture, but the remaining hour is still available. You can also download these notes as PDF. <em>I'm interested to find out if you think this is useful.</em>
