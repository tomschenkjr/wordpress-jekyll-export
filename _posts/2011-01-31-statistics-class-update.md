Class-

Those who attended Tuesday, 1/25, may have recalled that I ended class because I was not feeling well. That illness ultimately required hospitalization that led to the cancellation of Thursday's, 1/27, class. Over the weekend I've undergone an operation which will <strong>require me to cancel this Tuesday's, 2/1, class.</strong>

I am continuing to recover this week, but I am uncertain about the remaining classes this week. Nevertheless, we <strong>will</strong> be able to finish the semester. But in the meantime, I am behind on returning homework and responding to emails. I appreciate your patience as I try to get back on my feet this week.
