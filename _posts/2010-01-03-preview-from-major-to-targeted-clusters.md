The state of Iowa has established three targeted industry clusters: advanced manufacturing; bioscience; and information solutions. How have Iowa's community colleges been supplying the industry? Above is an ideogram showing the path from program major (left) to targeted cluster (right). Obviously bioscience is being well-stocked, mostly from health science majors. I'm a bit surprised though that information technology majors go on to information solutions at about the same rate as other targeted clusters.

I've already previewed a few ideograms which show the transition from college majors to industry of employment.
