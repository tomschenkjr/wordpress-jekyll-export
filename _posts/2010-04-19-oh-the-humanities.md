<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18edlifephd-gr.html?ref=edlife"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-127" title="18edlifephd-gr-popup" src="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/18edlifephd-gr-popup.png" alt="" width="200" height="176" /></a>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18phd-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=edlife">New York Times</a> has an article on the hardships of a humanities Ph.D. Among the highlights: it takes an average of 9 years to finish a humanities Ph.D. (if you do); high amount of debt (over $25,000); and the old age of graduates (35 years-old) which means less time available to recover all of that money.

The emphasis here, of course, is the <em>relative</em> decline in the quality of the humanities Ph.D. student. I've <a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/eegsu.pdf">pointed out</a> that there is a general increase in time-to-degree and debt, with fewer assistantships and more teaching duties for graduate students--but it's especially affected the humanities and, to a lesser extent, social science student.Â  This has led to an outgrowth of unionizations with the main goal of reducing adjuncts and increasing full-time faculty members.

Not much for comment here, other than the <em>Times</em> emphasis on data visualization--which are better than any table I put together on the topic.
