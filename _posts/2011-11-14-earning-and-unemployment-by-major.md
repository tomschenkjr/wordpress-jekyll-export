Wall Street Journal posted <a href="http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/NILF1111/#term=">data</a> from the venerable Center on Education and the Workforce on earnings and unemployment by college major.

<a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/median-earnings-unemployment.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334" title="median-earnings-unemployment" src="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/median-earnings-unemployment.png" alt="" width="600" height="416" /></a>There is a relative floor at $40,000 with a wide variation of unemployment (poor clinical psychology). There is a negative correlation between earnings and unemployment rate, but it might be too presumptuous to presume that high-paying majors get their cake and eat it too. Depending on the methodology, the higher earnings might simply reflect the fact they have a job.

Of course, median earnings is only one dimension. Below shows a messy graph that also incorporates the first and third quartiles:

Most of the majors had median earnings in the center of the inter-quartile range.

Similar data is also available for <a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/2010/04/12/n-tuple-line-graphs-wages-of-graduates-and-leavers/">Iowa community colleges</a>.

There are important threads in the data with are important to notice. The top 10 paying jobs are:
<ol>
	<li>Petroleum engineering</li>
	<li>Pharmacy/Pharmaceutical sciences &amp; administration</li>
	<li>Mining and mineral engineering</li>
	<li>Naval architecture &amp; marine engineering</li>
	<li>Nuclear engineering</li>
	<li>Mathematics and computer science</li>
	<li>Chemical engineering</li>
	<li>Electrical engineering</li>
	<li>Metallurgical engineering</li>

<div>These majors are at the core of the STEM disciplines--though the definition of STEM <a href="http://tomschenkjr.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/defining-stem-2010-1-11.pdf">varies</a>. Even though the notion that there is a lack of STEM majors is perpetually <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fstable%2F1883726&amp;ei=35PBTu3iGOvisQKTuMG0BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEI0sxdvCy8RhbqSitQbM67TjtyJQ&amp;sig2=6dlpamf380zYchto16wBOg">overstated</a>, it is clear that STEM majors still provide high wages  and an average unemployment rate for college graduates.</div>
<div>This data also reminds folks (parents, teachers, administrators, policy makers) that there is a moral duty to ensure every student has an <em>opportunity</em> to enter these fields. Some <a href="http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2011/11/about_all_those_stem_dropouts.html">think</a> it is only a costly effort to encourage students to enter in STEM majors since they may be under prepared and will inevitable drop-out. This could certainly be the case, but the most important efforts in encouraging STEM tends to take place in high school or earlier.</div>
