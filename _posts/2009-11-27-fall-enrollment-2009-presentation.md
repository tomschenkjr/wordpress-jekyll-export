The Iowa Department of Education <a href="http://www.iowa.gov/educate/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1899:community-college-enrollment-exceeds-100000-record-increase&amp;catid=666:highlights">released</a> the Community College Enrollment Report for Fall 2009. Enrollment exceeded 100,000 students for the first time in the fall semester due to a dramatic year-to-year increase. Below is the presentation given to the state board and the full report can be found <a href="http://www.iowa.gov/educate/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=8617&amp;Itemid=1507">here</a>.
