Starting a project where you need to make a series of graphs or a visualization can be frustrating. One of the hardest tasks is to find a theme, a style which you want to use. Though minimalism is the dominate "style" in data visualization, there is a lot of approaches to any graphical approaches. So I've started a blog, <a href="http://datanouveau.tumblr.com/">Data Nouveau</a>, to browse sources of influence for data projects.

It will mostly include graphs and data visualizations, but will also use other sources--such as art and movies--for ideas, such as color palette. Essentially, I hope it will serve as a sort of free style magazine for those starting new projects. I'm also <a href="http://datanouveau.tumblr.com/submit">accepting submissions</a> of any interactive, static graphing style, data visualization project, or anything that might help someone choose a color palette, graphing style, or layout for their own project.
