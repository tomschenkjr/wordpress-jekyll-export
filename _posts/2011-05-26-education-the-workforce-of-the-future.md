GOOD Magazine has put together an <a href="http://awesome.good.is/transparency/web/1105/educating-the-workforce/flash.html">infographic on the education demands for next generation's workforce</a>. It's a very timely topic for me and always a good reminder for students. Unfortunately, students who need to know this the most often do not understand.

Some common problems are abound in this infographic that are also apparent in other analysis. The "completion rate" of two-year colleges is underestimated since many students transfer to four-year universities instead of completing a degree. There is also a lot of pressure on colleges here, but there is an entire pipeline--from birth through school--that needs to be addressed.
